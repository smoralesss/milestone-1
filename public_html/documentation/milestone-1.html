<h1>How to Make the World A Better Place</h1>
<h2>Purpose, Audience, Goal</h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>Let's say there was an answer to one of the most important questions we could be asked today. I'm sure, like most reasonable people today, you would be skeptical. This is an effort to provide some food for thought, to one of the most asked, yet still unanswered, questions. Like most potentially controversial subjects, personal opinions need to be excluded. Cold, hard facts are the only things that will be included.</p>

<h3>Audience</h3>
<p>My audience is comprised of anyone and everyone who has access to an internet capable device. Whether it be students, professionals, policy makers, government agencies, business entities, or individuals, this page is designed for anybody with any demographics or varying backgrounds. Children may be the only audience in which the subject matter may not apply to or be appropriate for, and that is discretionary and subjective, as well.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>I want to make the world a better place. There are quality of life measurements that, when used in relation to countries, their social models and policies, and the effectiveness of their corresponding implementations of such modalities, show causal improvements (across the specified domains). In other words, if there was a checklist, if you will, of policies that countries can implement that alleviate the overcrowding of prisons, lower drug related overdose deaths, lower the transmission rates of infectious diseases, and increase the percentage of people who are actively engaging in their mental health wellness by using services, wouldn't you want to know about it? After all, most people just want to be happy. Our world is a direct reflection of us. Let's start by fixing us, holistically, from the inside, out.</p>

<h2>Persona</h2>
<h3>Name</h3>
<p>Regina George</p>
<h3>Age</h3>
<p>34</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>As an average user, I want to have non-biased facts presented to me, in an easy to read and digest format, so that I may feel confident in what I believe! Not to toot my own horn, but I've been known to binge watch tech tutorials on YouTube, a time or two. Aside from my technical strengths, I want to be a better person and by default, would love to change the world, if presented with the opportunity. If I can help solve an age-old riddle of global despair, just by pointing policy makers' in the right direction, by golly you bet your bottom dollar I'm going to do it!</p>

<h4>Technology</h4>

<h3>Frustration(s)</h3>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li><p>I am frustrated that the world seems to be getting worse. By this, I am alluding to the increases in: crime, particularly violent crime and mass shootings, drug offenses, and suicides, to start. </p></li>
        <li><p>With all the darkness, how could I not feel overwhelmed and aimless? I want to take action, I want to make a change! I just don't know where to start. I don't know how!</p></li>
        <li><p>What I would give, to have an information highway, unpolluted with bipartisan hoo-ha, no agendas, no searching for needles in a haystack. Just FACTS! </p></li>
    </ul>
</div>


<h3>Goal(s)</h3>
<p>I want facts.</p>
<p>Meaningful, unadulterated, data points so that I may draw certitude and verity.</p>
<p>I want to know the social implications of a country that introduces both decriminalization of drugs AND the concertion of the harm reduction model.</p>
<p>I want the up-to-date, no frilly facts, both good & bad, straight from the country itself! </p>
<p>Finally, I want to be one step closer to making the world a better place. I believe these findings will allow me to do so. </p>
